A minimalistic UI theme based on One Dark. Styling loosely based on [Light Table](http://lighttable.com). Created by [@jonikorpi](https://twitter.com/jonikorpi).

# Installation

Search for "jonikorpi" in the Install/Themes section of your Atom settings.

The theme inherits colors from whatever syntax theme you use. Most syntax themes should work fine, but I haven't tested light ones much.
