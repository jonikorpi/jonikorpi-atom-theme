A minimalistic UI theme, with colors based on [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and styling loosely based on [Light Table](http://lighttable.com). Created by [@jonikorpi](https://twitter.com/jonikorpi).

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to
the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
