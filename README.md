A minimalistic UI theme, with colors based on [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and styling loosely based on [Light Table](http://lighttable.com). Created by [@jonikorpi](https://twitter.com/jonikorpi).

# Installation

Search for "jonikorpi" in the Install/Themes section of your Atom settings.

You should use this theme with Atom's own "Solarized Dark" syntax theme.

If you have [Input Sans Narrow](http://input.fontbureau.com/download) installed, it will be used as the UI font.
